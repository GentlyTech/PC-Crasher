# PC-Crasher
A GUI to crash your PC!

Essentially what the title says, this program is intended to crash your computer by invoking a BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) (Windows only).

This program was made with Windows Forms, so therefore has a graphical user interface with an unecessary amount of loading bars and a long grace period before crashing the PC (so if you manage to *accidentally* crash someone's PC, you've got issues).

Use this at your own risk. I am not liable for any damage caused to the machine, or any data loss that occurs, etc.

The BSOD invoker script was not made by me. Instead, I got it from peewpw's Invoke-BSOD Git repository. The source is here: https://github.com/peewpw/Invoke-BSOD

Have fun, and change whatever you want!
